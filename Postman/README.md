# Postman Collection - RESTful API Tests

Collection for testing [restful-api.dev](https://api.restful-api.dev) with positive and negative test cases.

## Import

1. Open Postman
2. Click **Import** → Select `RESTful-API-Test-Collection.postman_collection.json`
3. The collection will appear with folders for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

## Test Cases

| Method | Positive Case | Expected Status | Negative Case | Expected Status |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **GET** | GET /objects/5 | 200 | GET /objects/99999 (non-existent) | 404 |
| **POST** | POST /objects (valid body) | 200 | POST /objects (empty body) | 400 |
| **PUT** | PUT /objects/5 (valid body) | 200 | PUT /objects/99999 (non-existent) | 404 |
| **DELETE** | DELETE /objects/7 | 200 | DELETE /objects/99999 (non-existent) | 404 |

## Assertions

Each request includes scripted tests that verify:

- **HTTP Status Code** – Expected 200/201 for success, 404/400 for errors
- **Response structure** – Presence of id, name, data where applicable
- **Business rules** – e.g. POST does not send id (auto-generated)

## Running the Collection

1. Open the collection
2. Click **Run** (Runner)
3. Select the collection and run all requests
4. Review the test results (pass/fail) for each request

## Note

- **POST**: Do not send `id` in the body; it is auto-generated by the API.
- **DELETE /objects/7**: Object 7 may already be deleted if you ran this before. Use a different object id or re-create via POST if needed.
